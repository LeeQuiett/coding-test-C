## About

This repository serves as a collection of coding problems and solutions that I have worked on while preparing for coding interviews and improving my problem-solving skills. The problems are organized by platform, and each solution is written in a clear, maintainable way, often with explanations or comments to help understand the approach.

## Platforms

Here are the platforms from which the problems are sourced:

- **Programmers**: [Link to Programmers](https://programmers.co.kr/)
- **Baekjoon Online Judge**: [Link to Baekjoon](https://www.acmicpc.net/)
- **Samsung SW Expert Academy**: [Link to SW Expert Academy](https://swexpertacademy.com/)
- **LeetCode**: [Link to LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- **Project Euler**: [Link to Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

<!-- ## Directory Structure

The repository is organized by platform and then by problem. Each problem may include the following files:

/<platform>/
/<problem-name>/
- README.md # Problem description (optional)
- solution.<ext> # Solution file (C, Python, Java, etc.)
- input.txt # Sample input (optional)

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coding-test-solutions.git
    ```

2. **Navigate** to the directory of the problem you are interested in.

3. **Review the solution** in the corresponding file. The file extension will indicate the programming language used (e.g., `.py` for Python, `.c` for C, `.java` for Java).

4. **Run the solution** on your local machine. For most problems, you can copy the code and run it directly in your preferred development environment.
